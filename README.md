Language: Python  

This is an Algorithm Written for Automated Number Plate Detection of Vehicles in Malaysia.

Libraries required:
1) numpy
2) os
3) pytesseract
4) opencv-python

Files: 
1) 0.jpg - 26.jpg
- Raw dataset Image files used for the algorithm. Images consist of various common vehicles with standardized number plates.
- Image size is 4032 x 3024 pixels. Size of the image is important for implemenation in the algorithm and needs to be consistent. 
- Commercial vehicles such as van, bus and lorries were not considered. 

2) FINAL_PART_2.py
- The python script used to run and execute the algorithm. 
- Project directory location needs to be modified when using
- Directory for pytesseract location also needs to be updated 

3) Final Report File
- PDF file explaining the process of the algorithm in detail as well as its results.
